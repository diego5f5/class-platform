# class-platform

## Running

To use the application in a complete and integrated way, you need a CMS structure that provides a graphql api.
In this example I use the "graphcms" tool.

To clone my project structure in this tool you can use this clone url "https://app.graphcms.com/clone/1b5d29051fdc438cb90da3bd0a22d2ed?name=Ignite%20Lab%20-%20Diego%20Ferreira"

After cloning the structure, it will be necessary to set some environment variables in the project.

First create a file in the project root, called ".env.local".
In this file add the variables:

```
VITE_API_URL="YOUR_API_URL_HERE"
VITE_API_ACCESS_TOKEN="YOUR_API_ACESS_TOKEN_HERE"
```

Note: You need to replace the variable values ​​with the corresponding values ​​from your project in the graphCMS tool
